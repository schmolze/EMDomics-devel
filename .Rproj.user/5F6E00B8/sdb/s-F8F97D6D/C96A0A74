Usually the data will be gene expression values from\n        array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other\n        types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number\n        variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of\n        Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA)\n        use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and\n        standard deviation) of the two distributions. This approach\n        lacks power to identify expression differences between groups\n        that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth\n        Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the \"work\"\n        needed to transform one distribution into the other, thus\n        providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between\n        two distributions. Permutation of sample labels is used to\n        generate q-values for the observed EMD scores.\nVersion: 1.1.1\nbiocViews: Software, DifferentialExpression, GeneExpression, Microarray\nAuthors@R: c( person(\"Sadhika\", \"Malladi\", email=\"sadhika.malladi@outlook.com\", role=c(\"aut\",\"cre\")),\n        person(\"Daniel\", \"Schmolze\", email=\"emd@schmolze.com\",\n        role=c(\"aut\",\"cre\")), person(\"Andrew\", \"Beck\",\n        email=\"abeck2@bidmc.harvard.edu\", role=\"aut\"), person(\"Sheida\",\n        \"Nabavi\", email=\"sheida_nabavi@hms.harvard.edu\", role=\"aut\"))\nMaintainer: Sadhika Malladi <emd.malladi@schmolze.com> and Daniel Schmolze <emd@schmolze.com>\nDepends: R (>= 3.2.1)\nImports: emdist, BiocParallel, matrixStats, ggplot2\nSuggests: knitr\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nLazyData: true\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\nNeedsCompilation: no\nAuthor: Sadhika Malladi [aut, cre], Daniel Schmolze [aut, cre], Andrew Beck [aut], Sheida Nabavi\n        [aut]\n",
